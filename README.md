# SoftUni Forum Workshop

Welcome to the SoftUni Forum project, an Angular Single Page Application (SPA). This comprehensive documentation will guide you through all four parts of the project, including key concepts, features, and instructions for each part.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the SoftUni Forum application, follow these steps:

### Frontend (Angular)

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `ng-app` folder, where the frontend code is located.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the Angular development server using the following command:

    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```

4. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:4200/ to access the frontend of the application.

### Backend (Node.js REST API)

1. Open a separate terminal and navigate to the `rest-api` folder, where the backend code is located.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the Node.js REST API server using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. The backend server will start and be accessible at http://localhost:3000/.

**Now, you can interact with the SoftUni Forum app by accessing the frontend in your web browser and making API requests to the backend server.**

## üåê Backend API Routes
